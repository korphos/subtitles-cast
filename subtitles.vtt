00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.540
Gentlemen, these planets
designated P3575 and P3A577

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.969
have been submitted by
Captain Carter's team

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.969
as possible destinations
for your next mission.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.969
SG units 1 and 2 will
operate concurrently.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.979
You know, I'm kind of partial to
P3575 if you don't mind taking P3A577.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.979
-No I'll take 577.
-I'm not married to it.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.979
-No, no it's.
-I want to be fair about it. How about we flip for it?

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.979
How about you go where I tell
you. As far as I'm concerned.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.980
Inbound traveller!
Repeat Inbound traveller!

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.550
Damn those Goa'uld's are persistent.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.450
I think we pissed them off.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.500
Closing the iris.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.460
Alert! All defence teams stand by..

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.520
Set the base auto destruct
countdown at 3 minutes.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.989
We're not going anywhere as long as
the Goa'uld keep up these attacks.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.490
They can't keep them up forever..

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.790
Can they?

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:24.790
Whoa!

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.959
Once they realise our Gate's
inpenetrable they should just give up.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.780
Part of me just wants to let 'em through.
Give 'em the fight they're looking for.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.480
Radiation team, move in.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.930
Well there have got to be
worse ways to go, I suppose.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.989
You don't think the Goa'uld's are
sending people through, do you?

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.490
Be like bugs on a windshield.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.949
Team reports all clear, sir.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.980
All right, stand down from
alert and abort the countdown.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.470
Kawalsky. What's the matter?

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.979
Headache. Took a fistful of
aspirin but nothing helps.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.979
Get down to the infirmary.
Get it checked out. Go on.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.979
Sir, I think I'll do that.
Sir, with your permission?

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.220
By all means Major, I need
you to lead your team to P3575.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.959
Inbound traveller! Inbound traveller!

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.790
Reset the countdown.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:51.959
Here we go again.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.530
All defence teams remain in position.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.470
So this iris is gonna hold right?

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.979
Pure titanium. Less than three
micrometers from the event horizon.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.979
It won't even allow matter
to fully reintegrate.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.480
So this iris is gonna hold, right?

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.979
If it doesn't, the failsafe
device will detonate,

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.989
this whole mountain will vapourise
and there'll be nothing to worry about.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.450
Ah. Good, I feel much better.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.440
Come.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.989
I can understand how Kawalsky feels.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.450
This job gives me a headache too.

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.989
Uh-huh. What's the bad news General?

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.840
Not much for small talk are you Colonel?

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.949
How was your weekend?
Get any fishing in?

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.780
I'm rejecting your request
to have Teal'c join SG-1.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.790
Wasn't my choice.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.959
A Colonel Kennedy is en route
from the Pentagon right now.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.959
He'll be asking your
friend some questions.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:02.959
What kind of questions?

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.969
What we're up against. Troop
strength, technology, weaponry.

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.969
I'd like to know the answers
to those questions too, sir.

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.969
But after they're done asking them..

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.979
There'll be more questions.
Possible tests....

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.979
After all he's carrying the
larval form of a hostile,

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.900
a very formidable
enemy, inside his body.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.830
What kind of tests are we talking about?

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.989
Maybe you haven't noticed Colonel.

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.989
But he's the first alien
species we've actually run into

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.989
You don't think that qualifies your
friend as a subject of scientific interest?

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.790
Subject?

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.800
He is what he is Colonel.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.959
With all due respect Sir, I don't
think he saved the lives of my team

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.959
or came over to our side so he
could become a damn guinea pig

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.510
US military intelligence.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.969
Back up Colonel. He switched sides once.

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.969
Are you 100% positive
he won't switch back?

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:51.760
Yes, Sir.

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.590
Well you are alone in that assertion.

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:56.979
Colonel Kennedy arrives within the hour.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.979
I promise Teal'c will be
treated with dignity and respect

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.979
for as long as he remains
a guest of this facility.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:06.060
Beyond that, I can't
promise a damn thing.

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.490
Dismissed Colonel.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.969
Hey, am I interrupting anything?

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.470
Yes.

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:32.760
Why don't I come back?

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.470
The people from Chulak?

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:39.979
We sent the last of them through the Gate just
before the Goa'uld started knocking at the door.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.770
Good.

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.440
Thanks to you.

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.290
So how long do you
think they'll keep it up?

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:53.490
One, perhaps two more attempts.

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.949
They will believe their
weapons have destroyed you.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:01.959
They will not send warriors through for
some time to make sure of your destruction.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.800
Well they'll be in for a surprise, huh?

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.760
Your iris will be closed.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.510
They will be crushed.

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:12.470
Surprise.

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:16.770
Am I a prisoner?

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.480
Ahh, yeah.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.480
I understand.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:30.520
We're not exactly living up to
your expectations of us, are we?

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:36.890
You see, Teal'c, we've been living alone

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:39.949
in our little corner of
the galaxy for awhile and

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:41.790
I think

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.959
the people I work for, just need
to get to know you a little better.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.959
I mean your knowledge of the Goa'uld
alone makes them a little curious.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.959
I will give that knowledge freely.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.969
Yeah, I know you will and
we'll put it to good use.

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:54.969
I will pledge my
allegiance to this world.

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:59.969
I'm just not sure that's ever going
to be enough for them to trust you.

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:03.860
To be honest with you, I
think they're scared of you.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:06.770
I understand.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:09.700
You must be used to that by now, huh?

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:12.450
I am a jaffa.

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:16.070
I have served as a
warrior for your enemy.

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:19.550
I have carried your enemy within me.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.740
Yeah. Well it's kind of a human thing.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.959
We tend to be afraid
of things we don't know.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.510
Why is O'Neill not afraid?

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:33.760
Teal'c...

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:36.470
I saw you stand up to a God.

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:40.230
Refuse to kill, I saw
you make that decision.

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:41.770
Yes.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.979
In that moment I learned everything
I needed to know to trust you.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:47.480
If I had killed you then,

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:49.770
I would not be here now.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.440
Neither would I.

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:54.989
I will prove my allegiance O'Neill.

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:57.880
Teal'c, I sure wish you didn't have to.

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:02.790
When I do?

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.500
You will show me this world?

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.460
Oh you bet.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.500
Just not all at once though.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.510
It's big.

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:25.790
And these headaches Major,

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.979
they started when you came
back from your last mission?

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.540
Yeah and they've been getting worse.

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:37.560
Anybody else on the team
experience these symptoms?

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:39.780
No Why?

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:42.720
It could be a reaction to Gate travel.

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:49.100
Look Doc, just give me a horse pill for the
pain, or something. It's a damn headache.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.460
What's this?

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.760
You didn't notice this?

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.510
What? Notice what?

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:02.470
Major!

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:07.460
So the device should be
on every planet we find.

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:10.770
I studied the one on Abydos for months.

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:11.979
It's sort of like a..

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:13.780
Telephone.

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.780
I like that.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:17.989
In order to get back
home all you have to do is

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:20.450
dial Earth Which is.

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:26.180
which is what we're
here to talk about so..

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.700
what is Major Kawalsky doing
in the embarkation room?

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.969
Page Colonel O'Neill and General
Hammond to the embarkation room, now!

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:41.510
Yes, Mah'Am!

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.480
-Charlie?
-Major Kawalsky?

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.490
Jack?

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:05.490
What am I doing here?

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.959
Hey, we gotta a sick man here!

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.460
Where the hell is he?

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.880
Was the Doctor here before?

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.470
I don't remember.

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:22.969
Sorry, Dr Nimzicki was
supposed to be on call.

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:24.969
Dr Warner, Chief Surgeon.
What's the problem?

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:25.760
Headache...

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:29.820
Little more than a headache,
Doc. Just had a blackout.

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:32.440
Hmm. We'll do an MRI right away.

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:35.480
See what's going on in there.

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.530
Take care of him, Doc. We need him.

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:42.450
Thank you.

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:50.790
Welcome Teal'c. This is Colonel Kennedy.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.959
I'm extraordinarily
pleased to meet you, sir.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.959
Colonel Kennedy's job
is to gather information,

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.600
knowledge, about our potential enemies.

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:03.640
I offer my knowledge of the Goa'ulds.

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:07.520
I offer my skills as a
warrior in defeating them.

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:10.979
I pledge my honour and
my life to this world.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:13.480
Well thank you.

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.780
This is just an informal meeting, son...

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:19.780
Take a seat.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:22.989
I have a lot of questions to ask
so if there are no objections....

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:24.989
What can you tell us
about the power source

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:28.310
the Goa'uld use to power
their weapons, ships?

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:30.790
Nothing.

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:32.790
I see.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.760
Do you yourself have an understanding of

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.959
the physics behind the Stargate?

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.460
-No.
-I see.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.969
Knowledge of Goa'uld magic is forbidden.

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:44.760
It's not magic Teal'c.

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:47.510
They just want you to think that.

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:49.890
Permission to barge in Sir?

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:51.770
Colonel O'Neill...

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:53.830
I was hoping to meet you.

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:55.979
Your mission report from Chulak

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.979
made for the most engrossing
analysis of my career.

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:01.960
Well thanks. What was
your favourite part?

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:04.550
Perhaps now is not the time Colonel?

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:07.720
General, you know what I went and did?

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:11.949
I told Teal'c how we all respect
a persons rights in this country.

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:14.959
I assure you, there is nothing
untoward taking place here, Colonel.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.500
Please, join us.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.460
Thank you. Hey Teal'c.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.760
O'Neill

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.969
That's Teal'c with an apostrophe.

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:26.880
T, E, A, L, apostrophe, C.

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:28.760
-Colonel.
-Yes, sir.

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:30.760
Very well, Teal'c...

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:33.979
Teal'c. What can you tell
me about the Goa'ulds?

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.440
They rule by force.

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:40.480
Their numbers were very
few but they are growing.

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:42.979
How many worlds do they control?

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:45.490
Many hundreds. Perhaps more.

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:48.989
And should we expect to encounter
these Goa'ulds everywhere we go?

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:50.780
It is possible.

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:54.949
But there are many more worlds
the Goa'ulds have no use for.

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:59.959
On those worlds the people are abandoned
and left to fend for themselves.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:02.959
Is there a leadership or Government
with which we could negotiate a peace?

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.760
Some, like Apophis,

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:08.980
are great Kings and rule over
many worlds as their Gods,

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:12.470
but they have no need for peace.

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:15.480
If they could kill you, they would.

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:19.730
Could they? They have spacecraft, right?

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:23.979
Yes. Without a Stargate, such a
journey would take many months,

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:25.780
perhaps even years.

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:28.989
It would take many
vessels, many slave armies.

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:31.989
We're not that much of
a nuisance, just yet.

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:34.670
These slaves, where do they come from?

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.959
There is a tale of a primitive world

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.500
the Goa'uld discovered millenia ago

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:42.460
The Tauri...

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:46.870
The First World where forms
of this type first evolved.

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:50.820
It is said the Goa'uld
harvested among the primitives,

00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:53.510
some became Goa'uld hosts,

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:56.770
others became jaffa.

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:58.979
the rest were taken as slaves

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:01.950
and seeded among the
stars to serve them.

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:05.070
But that world has
been lost for centuries.

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:10.600
Teal'c, beings of this
form evolved here on Earth.

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:16.920
This world..?

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:18.959
Is the world you're
talking about Teal'c.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.500
Ra came here.

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:24.959
If our ancestors hadn't
rebelled and buried the Stargate.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:28.969
You would not have become
strong enough to challenge them.

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:30.950
Then the galaxy is populated

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:32.969
by the ancient people of Earth.

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:34.969
There could be millions by now.

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:37.470
Then you are their greatest hope...

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:42.440
And mine.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.959
I'm gonna drop by the Control room.

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:08.959
By the silence around here, it seems as
if the Goa'ulds have finally given up.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:11.510
When was the last time you slept?

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:12.969
I don't know.

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:14.969
Doesn't help when the whole base
goes on alert every two hours.

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:17.510
No it's not that, it's just that..

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:20.979
my mind races and I can't
stop thinking about Sha're,

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.480
where she is, what she's become.

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:26.440
But you can't stay awake forever.

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:28.780
I can try.

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:32.870
No, you're right, I'll meet
you at the next briefing.

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:20.450
All right.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.790
Major Kawalsky?

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:29.959
We're all done here,

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:33.320
but I'm taking you off
active duty as of now.

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:36.470
Major?

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:41.510
"Security to the infirmary...".

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:04.670
Kawalsky, what the hell are you doing?

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.790
Close the blast doors!

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.460
Emergency in the Control Room!

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:20.470
Help me!

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:23.470
Kawalsky!

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:31.770
Don't shoot!

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.760
Put it down, Don't shoot! Don't shoot?

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.959
You know they won't let you
out of this mountain alive?

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:55.330
When those doors open, they'll
shoot on sight. You know that!

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:09.850
What the...?

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:11.979
Someone inside the elevator
hit the emergency stop.

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:13.770
Get those doors open!

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:14.960
Get 'em open.

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:17.880
Well it's about time. Gimme a hand here.

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:19.989
Charlie, what the hell's going on?

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:22.989
I don't have a clue,
Colonel, but she's hurt bad.

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:25.600
We have to get her to the infirmary.

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.760
The parasite's wrapped around his spine.

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:51.930
It's a... It's a Goa'uld.

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:53.770
Probably an infant.

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:56.979
They think that the reason it hasn't
been able to take you over completely

00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:58.780
it's not mature yet.

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:00.989
It's what's causing your blackouts.

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:05.060
What are you saying? I got
one of those parasites in me?

00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:07.989
Well how in the hell does that happen?

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:09.949
We were kinda hoping you could tell us.

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:11.959
You didn't feel it happening?

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.790
No.

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.810
When was the first time you blacked out?

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.470
I was here...

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:23.969
We'd just come back through from Chulak.

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:27.969
I thought it was just from
coming back through the Stargate.

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:31.230
We were helping that
kid, Casey was his name.

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.440
It was a sharp...

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:39.480
oh god Jack...

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:42.450
I thought I wrenched my neck...

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:48.240
Anyway Casey, he was all right,
they took him out of there.

00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:53.500
Oh god, Jack, you gotta help me.

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:56.570
MYou gotta get this thing out of me.

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:59.500
That's the plan.

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:04.969
I've taken Major Kawalsky off all pain
medication to increase his alertness.

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:06.969
It should increase
his ability to resist.

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:08.760
When can you remove it?

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:11.979
It would be an extremely
complex operation.

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:13.979
The parasite has literally woven
itself around his nervous system...

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:16.440
Can it be done or not?

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:19.480
Without killing him, possibly.

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:22.989
Without making him a quadraplegic,
that's a whole different story.

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:25.989
You just tell me who you need
to assist. Anyone in the world.

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:29.420
-I'll have them here within 24 hours.
-Yes sir.

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:38.510
When I was out, did I hurt anybody?

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.959
There's one man dead. A few more hurt.

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:43.760
Oh.. God..

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:48.969
Captain Carter's gonna be all right.
I was just gonna check on her actually.

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:51.969
-Oh I didn't mean to..
-No, she doesn't blame you.

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:56.979
You're not responsible Charlie. It's not your
fault. It's that damn thing that's inside of you.

00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:59.930
Look, as soon as they know how to do it,

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:03.989
they'll cut it out of you.
Right now, you got to fight it.

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:07.940
I don't mind telling you,
this is scaring me big time.

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:17.740
Teal'c, stand and face this way please.

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:22.280
What is the emergency?
They would not tell me.

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:23.959
That's none of your concern now.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:26.990
Kawalsky's become
infected with a Goa'uld.

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:31.969
And you wish to see if I still
carry the Goa'uld within me?

00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:34.470
Yes, now, please.

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:40.440
God, I hate those things.

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:45.490
Have you seen enough?

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:49.989
You understand we had to look and see.

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:50.989
What are its demands?

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:54.999
So far it's only managed to rear its butt
ugly head whenever Kawalsky blacks out.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.959
But it's already killed a man.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.959
Then there will be a
struggle for the host body.

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.959
It must have sought a host in
desperation before it was mature.

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:04.959
We intend to remove
it before that happens.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.969
It will kill the host if you try.

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:11.270
Once it is one with the host,
it is capable of killing him.

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:15.470
So, what do we do?

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:21.780
Charlie, we got General Hammond for you.

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:24.979
General, please. You gotta
tell them to do something.

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:26.780
The pain is too much.

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:28.989
We are, Major. You just have to hold on.

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:31.989
Now don't you give me that
good soldier crap, General.

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:34.989
You order them to cut
this damn thing out of me!

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:36.949
Teal'c says if they
do that you might die!

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:38.790
I don't care!

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.790
Look Charlie.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.500
They want to talk to it.

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.959
What! What the hell is
there to talk about?!

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:48.570
We must offer it life to save yours.

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:50.969
No! No! I want you to kill it!

00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:52.969
We must talk to the Goa'uld within you.

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:54.890
Jack, please help me, Jack!

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:56.969
Charlie, just let them
do their job will ya?

00:23:56.970 --> 00:23:59.979
No! Don't let them do this,
Jack! I want you to kill it!

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:00.979
His heart rate just doubled.

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:04.230
Kill it! Kill it! Kill
it! Kill it! Kill it!

00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:14.780
Nemes Kree!.

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:16.989
I won't speak to the traitor.

00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:18.790
You are their leader?

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:19.949
-I am.
-Speak.

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:22.959
I'm General George Hammond of
the United States Air Force.

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.959
Commander-in-Chief of
the SGC. And you are?

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:29.770
Interested only in returning
through the Stargate. Now!

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:32.750
You are in no position to make demands.

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:34.760
I have a proposition...

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:36.969
Release me now or I will destroy you!

00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:40.979
If you leave this man's body, we will allow you to live
and send you back through the Stargate in your natural form.

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:42.770
This body is mine!

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:47.530
If you are unwilling to leave we
will be forced to surgically...

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:49.780
Teal'c! Hold him!

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:52.650
Release me now or I will destroy you!

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:54.790
Do not attempt to escape!

00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:55.989
I command you!

00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:58.790
We will open fire! Colonel, stand aside!

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:01.500
Release me now.

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.790
Don't shoot!

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:07.500
-Hold your fire!
-Oh, oh god!

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:13.969
It's all right, son. I won't
put you through that again.

00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:15.760
Oh Jack, what did I do?

00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:17.760
Nothing,

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:21.240
you just got a little
mouthy. Nothing serious.

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:23.770
Dr Warner...

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:25.979
I want to know the
minute that godforsaken

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:27.979
thing can be taken out if my officer.

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:29.840
-Is that clear?
-Yes sir.

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:32.440
This conversation is over.

00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:38.450
As you were people.

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:43.959
In light of the day's events, Colonel
Kennedy has chosen to make certain

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.959
recommendations to my superiors
that I want to share with all of you.

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:48.790
Colonel Kennedy?

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:51.959
I know that many of you have
served with Major Kawalsky...

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:54.969
so please forgive me if what I am about
to suggest appears in any way callous.

00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:58.969
But I believe surgical removal
of the parasite may be a mistake.

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:01.969
General, this is a waste of
time Kawalsky does not have.

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:05.979
Dr Warner, what are Major Kawalsky's
chances of surviving this procedure?

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:07.770
10... 12% at most.

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:08.979
And the parasite?

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:11.979
It is an intelligent being
after all, isn't it Colonel?

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:14.989
I believe I first read
that in your report.

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:18.620
The parasite itself would
not survive the procedure.

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:20.989
So, we're faced with destroying one life

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:23.949
in the hopeless attempt to save
another. You see the ethical dilemma?

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:25.790
No, I don't.

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:29.959
My team and I are completely prepared to
perform the procedure, sir. We'll do our best.

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:32.959
Of course you will, Doctor.
Please don't misunderstand

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:36.969
We all wish the invading parasite in Major
Kawalsky's body could be safely removed.

00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:39.510
The facts are the facts.

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:40.969
I'm sorry, what was your point?

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:45.979
If we proceed with this operation,
Major Kawalsky will have died in vain.

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:46.979
And if we don't?

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:49.710
Well let's consider that for a moment.

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:52.979
These infant Goa'uld's,
they're so young,

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:56.890
so fragile in their larval
state that they require a...

00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:58.989
...I'm sorry what was
it you called yourself?

00:26:58.990 --> 00:26:59.780
Jaffa.

00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:02.989
For want of a better
translation, a what? Incubator?

00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:05.500
How is it they are so intelligent?

00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:08.959
A Goa'uld is born with all the knowledge
of all Goa'uld's that came before it.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:11.500
Genetic memory. That's amazing.

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:16.210
Yes it is. All the
knowledge of the Goa'uld.

00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:19.969
I just want you all to think on
that before we just throw it away.

00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:23.969
I've thought about it. You thought about it? I think
we've all thought about it. Any more thinking to be done.

00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:24.760
Colonel.

00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:26.979
Imagine if we could convince that

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:28.979
Goa'uld to share that knowledge....

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:30.979
A Goa'uld would not willingly share.

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:34.979
Teal'c is right. To them, we're
nothing. Less than nothing,

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:39.989
I mean think about it, they've taken on the roles
of our ancient gods. What does that tell you?

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:41.989
All right. What if we just studied it?

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:43.989
How much could we learn from that?

00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:47.949
What if we just faced up to the fact that
Major Kawalsky's slim chances of survival

00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:54.959
and realise that the greatest enemy mankind may ever
face has just been delivered right to our doorstep.

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:56.959
Even if we let it return through the
Stargate as a gesture of good faith.

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:58.760
How much could we ...?

00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:02.290
Just what kind of an
officer are you Colonel?!

00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:07.969
As long as there is a snowball's chance in hell that
my officer will come out of this procedure alive,

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:09.770
we'll go ahead with it.

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:13.979
With respect General, I feel I
should take this to my superiors.

00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:16.950
Me, I'll probably
just call the President

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:18.989
and get approval right
from the horse's mouth.

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:20.989
But sure, you go right ahead Colonel.

00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:22.780
Talk to your superiors.

00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:26.360
In the meantime people,
let's get the job done

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:42.969
Do you have any sense
the new anaesthetic

00:28:42.970 --> 00:28:45.969
is working better than
the last one we tried?

00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:46.760
Yes.

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:49.470
But your not sure?

00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:54.290
There's no communication at all
between you and the symbiote?

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:59.060
A jaffa does not communicate
with the Goa'uld it carries.

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:01.989
Well keep your fingers crossed.

00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:07.520
Nurse, you can stop this IV and release
the patient, we'll go with this one..

00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:12.790
They're getting ready.

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:15.500
It's about time.

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:17.790
How's the pain?

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:20.460
Maybe I'm just getting used to it.

00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:24.530
Listen Jack, if this doesn't work...

00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:26.969
Hey, come on, it's a cake walk.

00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:30.510
It hurts to talk, will
you shut up for a second?

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:34.440
I wanna be cremated.

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:38.979
I don't want there to be anything
left of that thing inside me.

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:40.780
You make sure, all right?

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:42.989
Look, can we not talk about this?

00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:45.540
When am I gonna talk about it Jack,

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:47.989
this could be my last conversation?

00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:52.010
Oh for crying out loud, it's
not your last conversation.

00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:56.310
Hey, I spoke to the
Doc, he told me the odds.

00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:58.790
Don't give me any crap.

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:01.500
Okay, it's our last conversation.

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:04.969
Your gonna be off on
some other planet anyway.

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:07.510
Yeah,P3A575.

00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:10.470
Whatever.

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:13.820
This was gonna be my first real command.

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:16.979
I was looking forward to it.

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:19.480
You still can, Charlie.

00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:22.440
They got me all tied up here.

00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:26.450
Give me your hand.

00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:35.130
I want you to know,
no matter what happens,

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:39.510
it was an honour to serve with you.

00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:49.969
Listen, I gotta ask you
something. It's not easy for me.

00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:52.470
We're friends.

00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:57.480
If you don't make it...

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:01.480
can I have your stereo?

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:05.490
What.

00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:10.450
It hurts to laugh.

00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:13.790
You all right?

00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:16.450
Never better.

00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:33.969
I've held back on the use of
anaesthetic until it can be administered

00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:37.020
to both patient and
creature simultaneously.

00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:42.600
Major Kawalsky, we're going
to begin the operation.

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:44.770
Are you ready?

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:47.490
I wanna say something.

00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:49.780
General Hammond, sir.

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:51.780
I'm here son.

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:55.760
If this doesn't work, I
want you to give the order.

00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:59.660
I wanna wake up as me or not at all.

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:07.510
You have my word, son.

00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:12.470
Scalpel.

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:22.440
Injecting anaesthetic.

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:28.440
All right. Start the clock.

00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:34.450
I'm making the first incision.

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:47.290
Separating the primary ganglia attaching
the parasite to the spinal cord now.

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:52.969
It's coming away more
easily than I'd hoped.

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:55.510
Must be the anaesthetic.

00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:57.820
At least it's going well.

00:32:57.970 --> 00:32:59.770
That's fantastic.

00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:03.979
If we can reverse what's happened to the
Major, then there's still a chance for Sha're.

00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:05.770
Let's hope.

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:09.210
The ganglia are still
constricting periodically

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:17.890
Obviously there still seems to be
some sign of life in this symbiote.

00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:21.500
I don't know how. Scissors.

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:33.969
There are thin filaments
extending up and into the brain.

00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:36.470
I'm going to sever them.

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:45.770
Hold him still!

00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:48.440
What's happening?

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:53.989
I don't know sir, I don't
think it was anything I did.

00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:55.780
I'd like to proceed.

00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:57.780
How much longer?

00:33:57.990 --> 00:34:00.450
Almost there.

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:06.460
Almost.

00:34:18.970 --> 00:34:21.510
I'm taking it out now.

00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:38.450
I think we did it.

00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:41.790
Close for me.

00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:44.450
Well done everyone.

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:52.959
That's right Dorothy.
It was all a dream.

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:55.510
Can you move your fingers. Toes.?

00:34:56.970 --> 00:34:59.510
Hey.

00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:05.790
Congratulations Major, you've already
exceeded my wildest expectations.

00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:12.440
Thirsty.

00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:22.240
Here. Easy big fella. You're
not drinking for two any more.

00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:24.790
I made it.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.500
See, I told you. Piece of cake.

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:36.969
I heard the operation was a complete
success, sir. Congratulations.

00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:38.969
And I have my orders
to return to Langley.

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:40.969
Don't let the door hit
your ass on the way out.

00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:44.690
With Teal'c, sir, I have
his travel orders as well.

00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:46.979
You do realise without his co
operation in finding an anaesthetic,

00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:49.780
the operation might have been a failure.

00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:50.979
I think we owe him something for that.

00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:52.979
Unfortunately, Teal'c
is now carrying the only

00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:54.979
living Goa'uld available for study
and we do need to study it, sir,

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:57.490
make no mistake on that.

00:35:57.990 --> 00:36:00.989
These aliens are possibly the greatest
threat this country has ever known.

00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:02.989
I'm well aware of the threat, Colonel.

00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:06.949
This facility is the front line.
It's the reason this command exists.

00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:09.959
We just go about things
differently around here.

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:12.460
I see..

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:14.959
well, I'll make the transport
arrangements in the morning.

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:17.510
You do that.

00:36:21.970 --> 00:36:24.969
Anyway, Colonel Kennedy's probably
gonna want to take it with him.

00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:26.969
so if you wanna see it once before...

00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:28.979
Are you talking about
that thing in my head?

00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:30.979
Daniel thinks it's fascinating.

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:32.979
I just thought you might wanna see it.

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:34.770
Nooo, thanks.

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:37.979
Hey, I just heard. They're
shipping Teal'c out to Langley.

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:40.989
- Kennedy's taking him with him.
- What? What for?

00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:42.989
Study. That's Kennedy's word.

00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:44.960
Right. Like a damn lab rat.

00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:47.920
Apparently Kennedy's
ethics are selective.

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:56.959
Listen, in case the Colonel
can't talk him out of it,

00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:59.959
I'd like a minute alone with
Teal'c before they ship him out.

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:01.969
He helped get me through this.

00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:03.760
I gotta thank him.

00:37:03.970 --> 00:37:06.470
Okay, I think that can be arranged.

00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:20.440
Hey, come on over here.

00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:25.060
Let me shake hands with the
man who helped save my life.

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:36.800
I'd like a minute alone with my friend.

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:43.910
I'll make it an order, does
that make you feel better?

00:37:56.980 --> 00:38:00.420
Jaffa! What they removed
was merely a dead husk.

00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:03.770
I had already become one with the host.

00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:05.780
I give you this chance:

00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:08.450
Serve me and you may live.

00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:13.790
I will not.

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:16.460
Then die.

00:38:30.970 --> 00:38:32.969
Colonel, I'm doing everything I can.

00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:38.979
So because he wasn't born on this particular planet,
he doesn't have any rights any more, is that it.

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:41.480
Get out!

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:45.490
Major!

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:04.460
What happened?

00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:09.969
The Goa'uld has won.
It's taken control of him.

00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:12.470
-How?.
-It deceived us.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.500
Jaffa! Kal Shak!

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:40.460
You cannot pass.

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:46.050
-What? -He set the
co-ordinates for Chulak.

00:39:53.970 --> 00:39:55.969
He set the auto destruct
sequence on the failsafe.

00:39:55.970 --> 00:39:56.979
How'd he have the code?

00:39:56.980 --> 00:40:02.150
I don't know but I need two ranking
officers to override and you're it.

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:22.160
All right that did it.
Open the blast doors.

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:28.470
Teal'c! Hold him there!

00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:34.470
Shut it down! Now!

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:15.510
He was your friend.

00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:19.470
My friend died on the table.

00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:40.949
If anything, the fact that he knew
how to set the auto destruct code

00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:43.959
proves there's hope
for Sha're and Skaara.

00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:44.790
How?

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:46.959
Cause only Kawalsky could
have known that code.

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:49.640
So something of the host must survive?

00:41:54.970 --> 00:41:57.650
Oh absolutely. That's good to hear....

00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:03.670
Oh anytime Sir, you just come on
down, we'd be glad to have you.

00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:07.979
Well hell Sir, he's right here,
why don't you tell him yourself.

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:10.920
I'm sure he'd like to hear it from you.

00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:14.450
Yes, Mr President?

00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:15.780
Yes, Sir.

00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:18.989
Colonel O'Neill, is
SG-1 ready to ship out?

00:42:18.990 --> 00:42:19.910
We are, Sir.

00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:22.949
Then you have a go for a
standard recon mission on P3575.

00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:25.500
Yes, Sir.

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:29.790
Reporting as ordered.

00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:32.460
-Sir... it's sir.

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:33.760
Sir.

00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:36.470
Welcome aboard son.

00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:41.950
The MALP reports conditions
on the planet are favourable.

00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:47.770
Well?
